4) In the present case of M/s Vithal Enterprises, Market analysis is comparatively easy because they are supplying products to only one customer. Various methods of Market analysis are not applicable here. M/s Vithal Enterprises have collected and analysed the data in respect of budget allocation for defence expenditure, the amount spent by Ammunition Factory in the last 3 years and their budget for the next year. Since, the customer is a Govt. Organisation, this information can be obtained by using the right to information act also.
M/s Vithal Enterprises are facing limited competition compared to normal projects, because their customers purchase the goods only from the short listed suppliers. Since, there are only few short listed suppliers, Vithal Enterprises can collect information about them by liasoning with his clients. Moreover, ammunition factory first invites quotations from the short listed suppliers and opens them in the presence of all suppliers. So, there is transparency in the system and one can get the information about the competitors. Hence, M/s Vithal Enterprises need not go for Market Survey and for general advertising and marketing strategies. He can only beat the competition by quoting lesser price and this can be done by reducing cost of manufacturing and going for lesser profit margin. Moreover, he has to maintain cordial relations with his clients. He can use the Delphi method, by getting the opinion of the officials working in the ammunition factory. He can repeatedly collect the information from them till some consensus is arrived at about the quality of the product they require.
