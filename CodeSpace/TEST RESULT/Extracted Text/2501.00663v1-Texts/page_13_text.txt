the “haystack”). In this part, we use Single NIAH (S-NIAH) task from RULER benchmark (Hsieh et al. 2024) and evaluate Titans and baselines on sequences with length 2K, 4K, 8K, and 16K. The results are reported in Table 2. Neural Memory module achieves the best results compare to baselines in all three tasks. We attribute this superior performance to three key differences of Titans with existing sequence models: (1) Compared to TTT, our Neural Memory can better handle the memory capacity by using momentum and also the forgetting mechanism (i.e., weight decay). Therefore, with increasing the sequence length, the performance of Neural Memory does not drop and show a consistent trend; (2) Compared to Mambaz2, which has the gating (forgetting) mechanism, Titans have deep non-linear memory, resulting in better memory management. Also, contrary to our neural memory and DeltaNet, Mamba2 is not capable of removing a memory and so
