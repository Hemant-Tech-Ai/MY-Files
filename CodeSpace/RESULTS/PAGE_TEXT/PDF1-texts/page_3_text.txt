2) Since this entity is a proprietary firm, it generally raises two types of funds — proprietor’s savings and loans from banks, non-banking financial corporations, friends, and relatives.

3) M/s Vithal Enterprises had bought a term loan of Rs. 5 lacs from a bank at a rate of 12.25%, which was to be repaid in five years. They have incurred the following expenses in connection with the loan:
12.25% + _30,000/5_ X 100 = 12.25 +2.4= 14.65% (5,00,000/2)
A company calculates the cost of equity, cost of preference cost of debenture and cost of term loans to compare them and to choose the most optimum mix of the capital. The mix of capital when the weighted average cost of capital is the lowest is the optimum mix.
Cost of Equity = PAT/Equity = 1.08/6.9 =15.65%
Weighted Average Cost of Capital = Proportion of equity x cost of equity + Proportion of debt x cost of debt = (6.8/12.16) X .1565 + (5.26/12.16) X .1465 = 15.08%
